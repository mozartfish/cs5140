this puts the omd em mark iii in the tricky position of being the middle brother of the omd family but releasing after the latest version of its bigger brother this means that it has to be significantly better than the em mark iii while not outperforming the emx which as the flagship camera is set to retain exclusive rights to certain prograde features so how will all this affect the specs and what should and shouldnt we expect to see in the new model heres our rundown of what the olympus omd em mark iii will likely look likewe already know that olympus is committed to micro four thirds and has no plans to move into fullframe imaging the company has stated time and again since photokina that it remains dedicated to the smaller sensor system and the release of the emx earlier this year only confirms that read more the cheapest fullframe cameras right nowindeed the company sees its rivals rush to move to fullframe mirrorless cameras as being to its advantage much like fuji it doesnt need to swim in fullframe waters when there are less sharks in the crop sensor sea so while it would certainly be a dramatic way to mark olympus th birthday the answer is no the em mark iii will not feature a fullframe sensor the question then is what kind of sensor will it havethe olympus omd em mark iiis sensor will still be a micro four thirds one then but how many megapixels will it boast while weve heard for years that the smaller format probably maxes out at mp the sharp k video camera boasts a proprietary mp sensor albeit in a ratio unlike olympus traditional providing a new ceiling for the standard read more panasonic ghs reviewwith olympus rd team having redoubled its efforts on sensor development in recent years researching technologies like multistoried photodiode cmos sensors the question is would the executives be willing to put a higher resolution sensor in the omd em mark iii when it sits below the omd emx in the the product lineupas noted earlier the emx rules the omd roost because its the professionallevel model while the new em would obviously have access to the same as well as superior technology the nature of the product line has traditionally prevented junior models possessing more advanced specs than their seniors in all likelihood then the omd em mark iii will benefit from a similar if not identical mp sensor to that of the em mark ii and emx unless olympus does a panasonic and does a massive zig where everybody expects it to zag
