olympus omd em mark iii what we expect founded in october this year sees olympus putting on a party hat and celebrating its th birthday and the company looks to be celebrating its centenary by releasing the longawaited olympus omd em mark iii during its birthday month the olympus omd em mark iii will be the third iteration of the groundbreaking original omd camera which spearheaded the mirrorless revolution for advanced and even professional users when it launched way back in february however a whole lot has changed in the camera industry since then where once olympus and panasonic stood alone in the mirrorless marketplace now every major players has gone allin and the big thing in is fullframe mirrorless with even panasonic shifting focus away from micro four thirds leaving olympus as the sole champion of the smaller format the oncecapable mp sensor in the em mark ii is now very long in the tooth and with modern rivals like the canon eos rp offering mp fullframe imaging and k video for just the midrange mirrorless market is no longer olympus plaything so the big question is exactly what kind of tech the latest and greatest omd em model will be packing and how it will balance its position within the omd hierarchy after all it has the entrylevel olympus omd em mark iii on one side and the professionalgrade olympus omd emx on the other this puts the omd em mark iii in the tricky position of being the middle brother of the omd family but releasing after the latest version of its bigger brother this means that it has to be significantly better than the em mark iii while not outperforming the emx which as the flagship camera is set to retain exclusive rights to certain prograde features so how will all this affect the specs and what should and shouldnt we expect to see in the new model heres our rundown of what the olympus omd em mark iii will likely look like
